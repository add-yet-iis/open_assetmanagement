Welcome to open_assetmanagement's documentation!
================================================

This Project is created to act as a starting point for the development of
an open source assetmanagement solution for IT and OT.
Therefore it aims to be easily expandable with new import modules for example
to import Industrial OT devices via Modbus or OPC UA.
The base project is developed by Luca Poehler for his Bachelor Thesis at FH Aachen, and the
further development will potentially be done by additional Bachelor Thesis.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.
